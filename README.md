## Description:

Lumus Library is an application designed to manage a library's book collection and user interactions. This project was built to promotes an interface to interact with [library-manager](https://github.com/Pris-c/library-manager/tree/adapt-for-frontend-integration) system.

The application has two user roles: USER and ADMIN:

- **ADMIN** role allows the user to manage the library collection, performing operations such as adding and deleting volumes in the database.

- **USER** role allows the user to maintain a list of favorite books, where they can add or remove books from the library collection to their personal favorites.

Additionally, it allows any visitor to access the library collection, view users' top 5 favorites, and register and log in to the system.
